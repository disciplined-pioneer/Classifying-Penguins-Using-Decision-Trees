To classify penguins, we have at our disposal a data set that includes several key characteristics: beak length and depth (culmen_length_mm, culmen_depth_mm), flipper length (flipper_length_mm), body mass (body_mass_g), as well as species and island habitat data. These numeric features will be the basis for training our model to classify penguin species such as Adelieids, Gentoos, and Emperors.

Each sample in our dataset is accurately identified as a specific species of penguin, and our model will learn from this data, aiming to correctly classify penguins according to their characteristics
